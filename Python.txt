 # py-str varname.tab to get all possible inbuilt function.
 # to iterate over an iterable object we use iter() function.
 # to get null values from rows we use loc,iloc,iax function
 # difference in loc & iloc is ,loc is label-based(needs to specify row & column labels)
   while iloc is int-position based (needs to specify row & column by 
   the integer position values,starting with 0)
 # differ B/W series & list :
  1. -ve index doesn't exist in series but we can access -ve index in list.
 # describe() gives a basic statistical overview of dataset 
 # ILoc(Integer Location) Function - helps us to select a specific row or column from the data set by checking the .
 # In Named Index when we try to access the value using Iloc function,it shows error because it access the data 
   through by default index while creating array,Where In case of loc function it allows to access the data.
 # pandas has 2 data structure 
   1. Series is 1-d data structure while 2. DataFrame is 2-d Data structure.

Q1. what is differ between changing axis & Transposing the dataframe ?. 


num=user i/p
rev=0 - variable to store o/p
digit=num%10 
rev=(rev*10) + digit
num = num // 10

  # 2.
 
NOTE - ONLY In case of for-else,else part only executes when for loop 
  portion is completely executed without an exception.
                     
 - series is equivalent to list , subset of dataframe
    - it's 1 unit of record represented in a sequence. 
 -if we pass the column as it is with variable name its data  type will be series   
and if we pass as list then its datatype becomes datatype
